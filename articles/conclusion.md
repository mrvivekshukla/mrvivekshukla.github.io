**Conclusion**

Due to India’s trade and economic bias in approaching Latin America-Caribbean (LAC) region, the potential for south-south cooperation in the diplomatic, cultural and defence sphere has been largely unrealized.

India has already become a major trading partner of many countries in the region. A recalibration of India’s outreach is required to maximize the potential of bilateral and multilateral relationships with the LAC region. With modest resource addition, little innovation and willful initiatives there can be substantial benefits in potential areas of cooperation.
