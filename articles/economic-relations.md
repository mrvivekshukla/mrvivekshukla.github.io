**Economic Relations**

With a population of over 630 million in 2015, the Latin America- Caribbean (LAC) region is a diverse and dynamic entity covering well over 13 per cent of the world’s surface, with a combined gross domestic product (GDP) of over USD 5 trillion in nominal terms or over USD 7 trillion when calculated by Purchasing Power Parity (PPP). It is in this context that India needs to enhance it’s economic ties with LAC region.

**Background**

Once realized the scope and potential of economic ties with LAC region the Indian Ministry of Commerce in 1997, initiated the FOCUS LAC program which aimed at:

-   Sensitizing the organizations, viz., Export Promotion Councils, Chambers of Commerce & Industry, EXIM Bank, ECGC, etc., involved in trade promotion efforts.

-   Incentivising Indian exporters and focusing on the Latin American region with added emphasis.

-   Focusing on Textiles , Chemical products, Engineering products and computer software for enhancing India’s exports to the Latin American region

**Trade**

India has moved to set in place a series of preferential trade agreements with sub-regional blocs and individual countries with the specific aim of increasing trade between India and the LAC region.

-   Latin America’s exports to India in 2014 stood at US$29 billion, despite impacts of commodity prices and exchange rates.

-   In 2015, India was Latin America’s sixth most important export destination with a value of $18.8 billion, while this is a significant drop from 2014, due to falling oil prices.

-   The total Indian bilateral merchandise trade with the LAC region increased from US$ 1.7 billion in 2001-02 to US$ 38.80 billion in 2014-15.

**Investments**

20 Latin American companies have invested nearly USD 1 billion in India in steel, multiplexes, bus assembly, auto parts and electrical motors while Indian investment in the region exceeds USD 15 billion in the information technology (IT), pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, mining, energy, and manufacturing sectors. Following entities lead the Indian Investment in the region:

-   Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) and Videocon in television and in IT respectively

-   Dr Reddy’s Laboratories and United Phosphorus in pharmaceuticals and in agrochemicals respectively

-   Shree Renuka Sugars and Havells Sylvania in sugar and lighting equipment respectively

-   ONGC Videsh in explorations of hydrocarbons

**Vis-a-Vis China**

Indian investment ensures employment of some 35,000 Latin Americans. When compared with Chinese investment in the region Indian investment seems healthier for economy of LAC region because:

-   Markets in LAC region are flooded with cheap Chinese manufactured goods adversely affecting the local manufacturing industry.

-   Chinese companies prefer Chinese labour over local labour.

**Importance for** **Energy Security**

-   Venezuela has the world’s largest oil reserves of 298 billion barrels while Argentina has the fourth largest shale gas reserves of 27 billion barrels.

-   The region has discovered more new reserves in the last decade.

-   The Latin Americans are willing to give extra discounts to increase their market share and India needs to reduce over dependence on volatile West-Asia.

-   ONGC Videsh, Reliance, Videocon, Gammon India and Assam Oil Company are major investors of the sector.

**Steps Taken**

-   Joint Commissions/Committees have been set up with Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, Cuba, Suriname, Guyana, Venezuela and Trinidad & Tobago.

-   The Federation of Indian Chamber Of Commerce and Industry (FICCI) and The Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India (ASSOCHAM) and Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) have been active in regular interactions and signing Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs) with similar bodies of the LAC region.

-   Also, in June 2014, the FOCUS LAC programme was extended to March 2019.

**Suggestions**

-   India and the LAC region must speed up converting of PTAs (preferential trade agreements) into FTAs (free trade agreements) and PTAs and FTAs should be explored with new partners.

-   Easing of tariff regime between India and LAC region for ensuring growth of trade as highlighted in reports of Inter-American Development Bank (IADB) and Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC).

-   It would be smart to use relations with Brazil as a foundation to build on ties in the region.

-   Removing infrastructural hindrances such as absence of direct shipping services between India and LAC region.

-   Strong and effective political ties are prerequisite for realising above suggestions.

-   Strong and effective political relations among developing countries are also a must for enhanced bargaining while negotiating on nationally determined contributions (NDC) and clean energy related technology transfer in international forums on climate change.
