**Political/Diplomatic Relations**

**Background**

India is emerging as an important global player and has been reaching out to Africa, East and South-East Asia with significantly prominent political, diplomatic, economic and even military/strategic focus but it has been hesitant and half hearted in its outreach towards Latin America-Caribbean (LAC) region.

**Present Status**

It is known that LAC region is resource rich and diverse. In this backdrop, in the past and even today India’s stress has been on maximizing the trade related engagements with the LAC region. India has started realizing only recently the importance and potential of full-fledged economic, diplomatic, cultural and strategic engagement with LAC region.

**Importance**

The need of reform in international forums like United Nations and India’s desire for membership in groups such as Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) etc. has widened the range of engagement with countries in LAC region. This is so because there are 33 countries in the region which constitute a significant voting bloc.

Because India engages with Brazil in groupings like BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) and IBSA (India, Brazil and South Africa) so, it has developed strong ties with Brazil but it needs to do so with other nations of the region also.

**High Level Visits**

In recent times – from 2001 onwards – there have been many high-level visits of heads of state and heads of government from India to the region and vice versa.

The Prime Minister of India has only visited Brazil once that too for BRICS Summit in 2014 but Minister of State for External Affairs, India’s Petroleum and Natural Gas Minister, Special Secretary, Ministry of External Affairs and even Vice-President of India has paid important visits to multiple destinations of LAC region. In these the visit of Minister of State for External Affairs to Venezuela was of particular significance as Venezuela is among top supplier of crude oil to India.

But there are two areas of concern regarding these high level visits:

-   There is apparent economic bias in these visits i.e. these visits stress mainly on increasing trade and investment with the LAC region

-   The number of visits from Indian side are significantly less when compared with the high level visits from LAC region to India

**Steps Taken**

-   Foreign Office Consultations held with some nations and Joint Commission Meetings (India-CARICOM).

-   India reached out to sub-regional groups like SICA (Central American Integration System) under which Minister of State for External Affairs of India had meetings with representatives of SICA in 2015, in Guatemala.

**Reasons for Poor Political and Diplomatic Relations**

India’s diplomatic attitude to the LAC region needs improvement because:

-   **Ambassadorial Absence-**More Latin American countries have embassies in India than India does in Latin America which needs to be equally reciprocated.

-   **Absence of Resources** -Glaring lack in adequate funding and proper staffs in Indian Embassies in LAC region. This is one of the aspects where India lags far behind China.

-   **Interpersonal Contact-**Due to barriers like language, distance interpersonal contact has been minimal.

-   **Diaspora-** Small in size and politically insignificant Diaspora.

**Suggestions**

-   Visits of the Indian Prime Minister and President to reflect the seriousness in approach.

-   India needs to deploy India Foreign Service (IFS) cadres who are specially trained for the region.

-   Once, the bureaucratic hurdles are removed tools like Centres of Excellence in Information Technology (CEITs) and ITEC (Indian Technical and Economic Cooperation) Scholarship Programme can help improve the political and diplomatic relations.

-   Inculcating the sense of urgency towards broadening and enhancing engagement on the bilateral diplomatic front is now indispensable.
