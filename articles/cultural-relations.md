**Cultural/Interpersonal Relation**

It is not desirable but India’s interest in the LAC (Latin America-Caribbean) region is heavily driven by economic interests with political interface largely dominated by its relations with Brazil through BRICS and IBSA. There is apparent absence of any successful academic or cultural exchanges from both sides. In this way India has remained remarkably unexplored by academics and policy makers of LAC region and vice-versa.

**The Diaspora**

-   The Indian Diaspora in the LAC region consists of two very distinct groups:

<!-- -->

-   The smaller group came post-Indian independence (for business purposes, employment-sparsely populated all over the region)

-   The larger group came pre-independence ( concentrated in Trinidad & Tobago, Guyana, Suriname and Jamaica)

<!-- -->

-   The Indian Diaspora in the LAC region is very small and politically insignificant.

**Reasons for Undeveloped Cultural Relation**

-   Distance and the impracticality of direct flights, hence, limited interpersonal interaction.

-   Absence of Spanish or English language news service from India despite presence of TV/broadcasting i.e. the language barrier.

-   **Not Knowing Today’ India-** LAC region gets all of its news about India filtered through the prism of Western news channels.

-   Absence of active Diaspora that could showcase India to their adopted countries.

-   Dearth of enthusiastic and capable diplomats (specialists) on both sides, lack of resources and huge information gap.

-   Absence of an articulated foreign policy for successful cultural engagement on both sides.

-   Insufficient and unenthusiastic attempts of Indian Council for Cultural Relations (ICCR).

-   Diversity of LAC region limits chance of success of India’s single approach for entire region.

**Way Ahead**

With it’s positive image in the LAC region India has the means and need of improving cultural relations with LAC region. It only requires a serious approach giving due weight to each of comprehensive policy framework, exclusively trained diplomats for the region, attractive and direct broadcasting of information on today’s India, proactive efforts by ICCR and finally proper utilization of present Diaspora in the region.
