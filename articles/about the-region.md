**About the Region**

Latin America refers to the territories in North, Central and South Americas where the Latin languages (Spanish, Portuguese and French) are spoken. The region covers very large geographical expansions, hence constituents of the region show great diversity. While mentioning the Latin America- Caribbean (LAC) geographic entity, it is important to note that history, politics or economic development of the region has not been inflexible. The LAC region can be divided into following components:

\(a\) Mexico

\(b\) Central America: Belize, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, and Panama.

\(c\) South America: Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana, Paraguay, Peru, Suriname, Uruguay, Venezuela

\(d\) English speaking Caribbean: Antigua and Barbuda, The Bahamas, Barbados, Dominica, Grenada, Jamaica, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Trinidad and Tobago

\(e\) Non-English speaking Caribbean: Cuba, The Dominican Republic, Haiti.

\(f\) Foreign overseas territories/colonies: Anguilla, Bermuda, British Virgin Islands, Cayman Islands, Montserrat, Turks and Caicos Islands, (British Overseas Territories), Puerto Rico (Commonwealth of the United States of America), US Virgin Islands (organized, unincorporated US Territory Guadeloupe, Martinique, Saint- Barthélemy, Saint Martin, French Guiana (France), Aruba, Bonaire, and Curaçao, Sint Eustatius, Saba, Sint Maarten (Netherlands).

The above categorization is based on some broader characteristics like language, location or colonial linkages but there are many parameters such as literacy, economy (agriculture, industry, tourism and international trade), ethnicity, culture and size of the components which add to the diversity of the region.

Mexico, here has a distinct category on account that it is considered part of North America for being member of NAFTA (North America Free Trade Agreement) while United Nations considers it in Central America.

The diversity of the region's economies lends itself to broad-based engagement on the economic front because the level of economic development in LAC region is varied for it’s countries.

This diversity in present day economies of the region can easily be traced to their respective political histories as in some cases the transition of power from colonial masters was smooth and relatively peaceful while in others it was only with bloody revolutions. Also, presence of some institutional setups (judicial, political etc.) gave some extent of stability to the region which was otherwise deeply indulged in civil wars in post colonial period.
