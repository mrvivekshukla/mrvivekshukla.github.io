**Security Relations**

While the economic and diplomatic dimensions of India’s relationship with the LAC region have acquired a dynamic of their own. Due to certain shortcomings and some lack of impetus Security as potential area of co-operation has largely remained unrealized.

**Scope of Co-operation**

-   High-technology industries such as shipbuilding and aerospace, there is little interaction between Indian shipyards and their LAC counterparts.

-   Defence Production, Research and Development (joint ventures) and significant Joint Military Exercises.

-   Military training, equipment (lethal and nonlethal) and overall security cooperation.

-   Pirate attacks and terrorism, Disaster Management, humanitarian assistance and co-operation in UN peacekeeping forces.

-   Sustained diplomatic efforts targeting not just political but military stipulated requirements too.

-   Intelligence and Law enforcement collaboration in anti-Narcotics trade.

**Trade in Defence Equipments**

Modest but no insignificant are the sales of:

-   Mahindra Rakshak armoured vehicles and one Mahindra Rapid Intervention Vehicle to Guyana Police Force.

-   Ashok Leyland 4x4 trucks to the Honduran army, Mahindra 4x4 vehicles to Argentina, Uruguay and Belize, Mahindra Marksman vehicles to the Chilean Carabineros Special Forces.

-   Indigenously made civil model Dhruv helicopters to Peru and Ecuador and Chetak helicopters to Suriname.

-   Import of Embrace EMB-145 aircraft from Brazil for domestic Airborne Early Warning.

There is a serious concern about poor spares support and other technical and security flaws in equipments in equipments from India.

**Importance of Improving Strategic Ties**

-   Sharing effective strategic ties with LAC (Latin America-Caribbean) region through various channels like defence production, R&D, significant Joint Military Exercises and exchange of personnel etc. would inevitably bring a higher Indian defence profile in the region.

-   Also, glaring presence of China in the region, demands that India must include defence, space, energy, and nuclear co-operation with the region in it’s priority engagements.

**Suggestions-**The vast gap in co-operation demands that south-south co-operation in strategic arena should be highest priority in India’s engagement with LAC region. The strategic relations with US, the WEST and South East Asia should not be at the cost of ties with LAC region.
